      <p>
        The Olive Ridley, Leatherback, Hawksbill, Loggerhead, and Green Turtles are among the seven remaining species of sea turtles on the planet.
        Each year, they travel thousands of miles in search of warmer waters to lay 80 to 120 eggs at a time before making the arduous journey back 
        to their homes in the Pacific or Atlantic Oceans.
        <br><br>
        Given that they are present along most of Sri Lanka's coastline, you have a good possibility of spotting turtles there.
        Simply keep your snorkeling equipment close to you and keep an eye out wherever you go. 
        But we're going to let you know some of the greatest places to go that might give you a better chance of seeing them! 
        In Sri Lanka, we had the best success snorkeling with turtles in Hikkaduwa, Mirissa, and Trincomalee. 
        We experienced the best and most frequent sightings in these locations! These are the regions where we had the best experiences; however, this isn't a guarantee for everyone.

                                        Sri Lanka is well known for its stunning beaches and incredible wildlife.
                                         Turtles are undoubtedly one of the most alluring and priceless species of wildlife in Sri Lanka.
                                          Five of the seven different turtle species found worldwide can be found in the sea off the coast of Sri Lanka. 
                                          Three of the five species of turtles discovered in the waters around Sri Lanka are threatened, one is fragile,
                                           and one is seriously threatened. To nest, they travel to Sri Lanka's coastline. In actuality, Sri Lanka's southern 
                                           coast is home to a significant number of sea turtles. Therefore, they require conservation. And that's where the turtle
                                            hatcheries enter the picture.</div>

                                <div class="Grid-img"> <img src="Images/greenSea.jpg" alt="green-Sea" height="500" width="500"></div>
                                        <p>The green turtle is one of the largest marine turtles and the sole herbivore among the numerous types. Green turtles are named 
                                            for the green color of their cartilage and blubber, not their shells.
                                            The green turtle is prevalent in Sri Lankan waters. weights about 250 kg, may reach a maximum length 
                                            of 1 meter and can lay between 120 and 40 eggs at a time as an adult female. Green turtles are found mostly in 
                                            tropical and subtropical waters. Like other sea turtles, they move considerable distances from their hatching locations to feeding places and beaches.
                                            Classified as endangered, green turtles are threatened by overharvesting of their eggs, hunting of adults, entanglement
                                             in fishing gear, and loss of nesting sites on beaches.

                                        <p>The largest turtle in the world is the leatherback sea turtle. They are the only type of marine turtle that 
                                            lacks hard shells and scales. They have been there since the time of the dinosaurs and get their name from their tough, rubbery skin. 
                                            Some leatherbacks travel more than 10,000 kilometers annually between their rookeries and feeding grounds. They can dive to depths 
                                            of about 4,000 feet, which is deeper than most marine mammals. They are exceptional divers.
                                            Of all reptile species, and arguably of all vertebrate species, leatherbacks have the greatest geographical 
                                            distribution. The Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, as well as the Mediterranean Sea, all have tropic and temperate 
                                            waters where they can be found. In addition, adult leatherbacks travel as far south as New Zealand and South America and as far north as Canada and Norway.

                                            <div class="Grid-img">     <img src="Images/loggerhood.jpg" alt="LoggerheadTurtle" height="500" width="500"></div>
                                        <p>The enormous heads of loggerhead turtles support strong jaw muscles that enable them to crush hard-shelled prey like
                                             clams and sea urchins, which is how they got their name. 
                                            They are less likely to be killed for their meat or shell compared to other sea turtles. Although they frequently come
                                             into touch with fisheries, loggerhead turtles face a major problem with accidental capture of marine species in fishing gear.
                                            As their name suggests, loggerhead turtles are often red and brown in color, and their huge heads make them simple to spot!
                                             They are mostly carnivores that may reach a maximum height of 1 meter and weigh between 170 and 200 kg. Their big, powerful jaws
                                              are perfect for crushing their preferred prey, mollusks, and crustaceans.

                                            <p>The hawksbill sea turtle, which is found in tropical regions all over the world, is regarded by many as the most beautiful of all sea turtles because of its vibrant shell. They spend their time in lagoons, mangrove forests, marine islands, coral reefs, and rocky places.
                                                Hawksbills are so named because they can reach into the cracks and crevices of coral reefs in search of food. They have a narrow head and pointed, bird-like beaks. Their diet is quite specialized, and they eat virtually nothing except sponges. One of the smaller turtles, adults can grow to a length of 2-3 feet (roughly).
