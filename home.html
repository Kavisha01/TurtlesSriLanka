        <p>Everywhere in the world, there is an increasing amount of interest in turtles. The vast majority of peaceful people in various nations are eager to protect and supply sanctuaries for turtles, while a tiny minority of carnivorous individuals are determined to destroy these endangered marine turtle species for their meat and shells. For over 190 million years, marine turtles have been swimming across the oceans. Only eight of the numerous variations of this species can still be found in the wild today.</p>

      <h2>Where Can We See Sea Turtles In Sri Lanka</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="content_3">
      <p>One of the best locations for sea turtle volunteer work in Sri Lanka. There have been sea turtles for millions of years. These amazing creatures were already gliding through our oceans when T-Rex and his dinosaur allies controlled the planet Earth. Sea turtles have been around for a long time but are still very susceptible to natural and man-made threats. Unless effective programs are implemented and maintained to conserve sea turtles, experts believe that all of the many species may become extinct. Each worldwide turtle volunteer is vitally needed since conservation initiatives demand extensive resources that many developing nations, like Sri Lanka, cannot afford.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="content_4">
      <p>It is an unexpectedly amazing experience to watch the turtles. You will always remember watching these serene and tranquil marine animals swim leisurely, hunt for their next food, or be dragged to a sandy beach to lay their eggs.</p>

    <div class="content">
      <p>Any sea turtle hatchery is best visited around the time when female sea turtles are returning to their nesting areas to lay their eggs. These sea turtles will only be in this trance-like state and unafraid of observers at this specific time. However, sightings are uncommon from October to January when only one or two turtles are seen at night. Volunteers collect the hatching eggs and keep them in the protected surroundings of the conservation site until they are ready to hatch. You might even be able to return a few hatchlings to the Big Blue if you're fortunate!</p>

      <h3>Tips For Visiting A Turtle Hatchery</h3>
      <p><b>Here are some practical suggestions to help you get the most out of your trip to the Sea Turtle Hatchery in Sri Lanka:</b></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Take part in their turtle conservation tour to learn more about marine turtles. Every visitor to the Sea Turtle Hatchery of Sri Lanka is given access to an informative tour during which they can learn more about the evolution of sea turtles as well as the processes involved in their hatching and conservation.</li>
        <li>Female sea turtles prefer to lay their eggs in quiet, dark areas, so as a kind tourist, be sure not to turn on the flashlights on your DSLRs or cellphones.</li>
        <li>Try not to feed any of this wildlife because doing so could leave them vulnerable to unforeseen illnesses and infections.</li>
        <li>Be cautious to leave the hatchery clean after visiting by not leaving your plastic bags lying around. The worst part is that the sea turtles might believe their carry-on luggage to be food, leading to confusion.</li>
        <li>Remain a reasonable distance away from these sea turtles' breeding locations.</li>
        <li>Make sure you don't leave any carbon footprints from your trip to the sea turtle hatchery behind, such as food waste or wrappers, as any climatic changes may modify the food supplies, which could have negative impacts from its bioaccumulation.</li>
