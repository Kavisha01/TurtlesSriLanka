								<ul>
									<li>Turtle Hatchery is located on the beach, roughly 2 km north of Hikkaduwa. The hatchery is a tiny, private 
										research facility that demonstrates the turtles' progressive growth and works to preserve marine turtles, which are at risk of extinction.</li>
										
										<li>There are some spots where you can also get an opportunity to release baby turtles into the vast ocean for an additional fee. 
											March through April are the greatest months to go and watch the turtles.</li>
											
										<li>A modest yet excellent turtle farm and rescue facility is Hikkaduwa Tertle Farm or Sea Turtle Hatchery. Visitors can view turtle eggs
											 that are safely buried in the hatchery's sand here. The average time for the eggs to hatch in two days. </li>
											 
										<li>In order to safely release the turtles into the water, where they can live in their natural habitat, they are handled very carefully and 
											with great attention to their proper development. Visitors can witness turtles of all sizes here because of this. Turtles must mature before being 
											set free to live on their own.</li>
											
										<li>Visitors will regrettably be able to see turtles with malformed body parts, such as those without a front or back legs. Because of this,
											 this property is regarded as a unique shelter that helps disabled turtles find balance and sustain their lives.</li>

									<p>In the Southern Province of Sri Lanka, on the South Coast, 
										Hikkaduwa is about 61 miles (or nearly 17 kilometres) northwest of Galle District. 
										The beach at Hikkaduwa, which is well-known for its beaches and powerful tides, is dotted with palm trees, restaurants, and bars.
										The southern shore of the island is home to a number of turtle hatcheries, including this one. It began as a community initiative to help safeguard 
										the southern coast's biodiversity, but it has since developed into a full-fledged hatchery and rescue facility with devoted personnel that toil around 
										the clock to study, look after, and safeguard various turtle species.In 
										Sri Lanka, using the public transportation system is a fantastic way to experience the local way of life and take in some breathtaking sights. </p></div>

									   <!--Things To Do In Hikkaduwa--> 
				  <p>Snorkeling is one of the most popular activities in Hikkaduwa Beach. The reason is that Hikkaduwa is home to one of Sri Lanka's two marine parks.
				  
					  Rent some snorkeling equipment, then hop on a quick boat to the Hikkaduwa Coral Reef. When you get there, jump in and take in the sights of the aquatic world.
					  
					  
					  The usual price for a snorkeling trip is about 2,000 rupees for an hour, and there are several local tour operators who can arrange these. 
					  
					  Snorkeling is most enjoyable between November and April of each year.
					  </p>
				  
					  <img src="Images/glass-boatride.jpg" alt="Glass Boat Ride" height="400" width="400" >
												
				  <p>If snorkeling isn't your style or your kids are too little, taking a trip on a glass-bottom boat is the ideal (and interesting) method to view the underwater world.
				  
					  On the main beach, transparent bottom boats can be rented and independently explored.
					  
					  
					  As you paddle, catch glimpses of the undersea environment below.  It costs roughly 4,000 rupees.
					  
					  </p>

					</p>
					
												
					  <p>Perhaps obvious, but simply spending time on the beach is one of the nicest things to do in Hikkaduwa.
				  
						  Discover the several beaches in the area, enjoy the breathtaking sunsets, and go swimming.
						  
						  
						  One of our top Hikkaduwa recommendations is to keep an eye out for enormous turtles in the shallows at the southern end of the beach later in the day.
						  
						  One of the best things to do in Hikkaduwa Beach, Sri Lanka, is to observe these giant animals in their natural environment.
						  
						  </p>
				  
						  <img src="Images/surfing.jpg" alt="surfing" height="400" width="400">
												
						  <p>Water sports in Hikkaduwa are one of the most popular things to do and the area is famous for surfing among adventure enthusiasts.
						  
							  The clean waves and consistent swell are what attract surfers to the area to enjoy this fun outdoor activity.
							  
							  Surfboards are available for hire on the beach. It is a good place to learn to surf as the waves are often suited for beginners. Ask any one of the board rental guys to teach you in return for a fee.
							  
							  They also have paddleboards for rent, which is a fun way for kids to explore the water when the waves are small
